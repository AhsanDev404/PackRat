## Installation and Usage üì≤

PackRat consists of two main components: a client and a server. Follow the steps below to install and run both components.

### Client

1. Navigate to the `client` directory: `cd client`.
2. Create a new file called `.env` and add the necessary environment variables. You can copy the `.env.example` file and replace the values with your own.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the app using `npm start`.

### Server

1. Navigate to the `server` directory: `cd server`.
2. Create a new file called `.env` and add the necessary environment variables. You can copy the `.env.example` file and replace the values with your own.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the server using `npm start`.

Make sure to start the server before starting the client, as the client relies on the server for data.

Note that the client and server are designed to run concurrently in development mode. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the app using `npm run dev`.

This will start both the client and server simultaneously.
